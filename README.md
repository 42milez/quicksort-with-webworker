# Overview
I started this project for benchmarking the performance of quick sort with JavaScript.
There are the two parts in this project. One of them evaluates the performance of recursive quick sort.
Another one evaluates only non-recursive quick sort performance.
Some of the non-recursive quick sort benchmarking are evaluated with one or two worker threads.
